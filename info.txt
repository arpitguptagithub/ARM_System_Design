The work flow of this repository is centered around the ARM.v file, which is the main module that instantiates and connects various other modules.
The ID_Stage_Reg, EXE_Stage, ID_Reg, ID_Stage, MEM_Stage, WB_Stage, IF_Reg, Adder, Val2_Generate, and ALU modules are all instantiated within the ARM.v file.
These modules work together to perform various tasks such as instruction decoding, execution, memory access, and register file management. 
The ARM.v file acts as the top-level module, orchestrating the flow of data and control signals between the various sub-modules.
